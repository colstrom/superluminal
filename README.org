~superluminal~ is a tool for managing AWS infrastructure, built on =aws-sdk=. It
is intended for use alongside [[https://github.com/ansible/ansible][Ansible]].

* Background

  Ansible does a pretty good job of handling AWS, but there are cases where
  features either haven't been implemented yet, or are very cumbersome to
  manage.

    1. While there is a method for putting an object in an S3 Bucket, there is no method for creating a bucket.
    2. There is no method for creating an IAM role, or defining a User Policy for one.
    3. There is no method to create peering between VPCs.

* License

  ~git-ready~ is available under the [[https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license][MIT License]]. See ~LICENSE.txt~ for the full text.
